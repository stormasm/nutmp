### Storm Update November 01, 2023

As noted I have taken my name off the *plugins* bullet in the
[bullet ownership list](https://hackmd.io/z28xTn7LQGG8wsrIkTWsEw)
to focus more of my energy and passion in the end user nushell ecosystem.

Examples of this include projects by

* @kubouch and @amtoine on the nupm package manager
* @amtoine and @melmass on the nu-git-manager

At the moment [@andrasio](https://github.com/andrasio) is the key owner of this
task moving forward.  It may turn out and the core team will need to decide
whether we want this project to be a post 1.0 event.
