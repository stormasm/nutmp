### Storm Update November 01, 2023

I have taken my name off the *plugins* bullet in the
[bullet ownership list](https://hackmd.io/z28xTn7LQGG8wsrIkTWsEw)
to focus more of my energy and passion in the end user nushell ecosystem.

Examples of this include projects by

* @kubouch and @amtoine on the nupm package manager
* @amtoine and @melmass on the nu-git-manager

Initially I have been kicking the tires on both of these projects mainly
testing out the features and finding some minor bugs that I have come across.

At the moment [@andrasio](https://github.com/andrasio) is the key owner of the
*plugins* task moving forward.  It may turn out and the core team will need to decide
whether we want this project to be a post 1.0 event.

I am really excited about nushell and look forward to working with other
end user ecosystem projects including...

[nuPHP:](https://github.com/mikayla-maki/nuPHP)
The nu Personal HomePage webserver and example website.
